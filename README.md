# Python Development for YOLOv8 & YOLOX 

Basic Requirement for development and procedure for dependency installation:

## 1. Install dependency
   - Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv_python`
   - Install Ultralytics YOLO: `pip install ultralytics`
     
## 2. Prepare YOLO model
```
python3 Training.py
```
   - if you has recived available YOLO which has been trained for detection blackline, then making a change for "yolov8n.pt" to be part of particular model.
   - if you no model yet, you may trainning YOLOv8 with avaiable dataset which contain black line on top of gold backgound.

## 3. Run the code 
   - Run python code to make sure the code can be passed run and able to initilized real time detecting via camera.
   - The code will be display 2 panel, the frist panel is result form YOLO and ellipse around blackline and sencond panel is mask of the black line.
